define Package/python-greenlet/description
  The greenlet package is a spin-off of Stackless, a version of CPython
  that supports micro-threads called "tasklets". Tasklets run
  pseudo-concurrently (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads)
  and are synchronized with data exchanges on "channels".

  A "greenlet", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of
  micro-thread with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other
  words. This is useful when you want to control exactly when your code
  runs. You can build custom scheduled micro-threads on top of greenlet;
  however, it seems that greenlets are useful on their own as a way to
  make advanced control flow structures. For example, we can recreate
  generators; the difference with Python's own generators is that our
  generators can call nested functions and the nested functions can
  yield values too. Additionally, you don't need a "yield" keyword. See
  the example in tests/test_generator.py.

  Greenlets are provided as a C extension module for the regular
  unmodified interpreter.

  Greenlets are lightweight coroutines for in-process concurrent
  programming.
